# Yang–Mills OS Quantization Interface

This repository isolates the final obstruction in the Yang–Mills mass gap problem:
construction of an Osterwalder–Schrader positive Euclidean measure.

All classical and semiclassical analytic inputs
(coercivity, Kato/FLIC control, HS-gap refutation)
are assumed verified upstream.

Status: OPEN — external, non-perturbative obstruction.
