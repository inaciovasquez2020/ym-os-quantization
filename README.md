# Yang–Mills OS Quantization

This repository explores non-perturbative Osterwalder–Schrader positivity
for Yang–Mills theory under the assumption of verified uniform coercivity.

Assumed inputs:
- Uniform Jacobi coercivity (verified elsewhere).
- Semiclassical stability.

Non-goals:
- No classical analysis.
- No HS-gap arguments.
- No claims of mass gap.

Status:
- Exploratory.
- No verified results at present.
