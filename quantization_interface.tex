\section*{Quantization Interface and OS Reduction}

The uniform coercivity of the Yang--Mills Jacobi operator establishes stability of the
instanton vacuum at the classical and semiclassical levels.
The remaining step toward a mass gap theorem is a non-perturbative quantization
satisfying the Osterwalder--Schrader axioms.

Specifically, one must construct a probability measure on gauge-equivalence classes
of connections such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reflection positivity holds with respect to a time-slicing compatible with the instanton background.
\item The Euclidean action admits a well-defined OS-positive extension.
\item The induced Hamiltonian exhibits a spectral gap consistent with the classical coercivity bound.
\end{itemize}

All analytic ingredients required for this step are external to the present work.
The current results reduce the mass gap problem to this quantization step alone.
\end{itemize}
